### Methods
The convolve1D method performs the convolution of two 1D arrays of Complex numbers

### Polynomial
The Polynomial class represents a mathematical polynomial in the complex plane. The polynomial is defined by its coefficients, which are provided as a parameter to the class constructor. The class provides methods for evaluating the polynomial at a given complex value, multiplying the polynomial by another polynomial, and checking if the polynomial is equal to another polynomial. The class also provides a method for evaluating the polynomial at multiple complex values at once.
